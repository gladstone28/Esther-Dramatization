### Act 3: The Plot Unfolds

Time passes. Haman, a powerful advisor to the king, grows furious when Mordecai refuses to bow to him. Haman devises a plan to annihilate all Jews in the kingdom.

**Haman:** (in the king's court) There is a certain people scattered among the provinces of your kingdom. Their laws are different, and they do not obey the king's laws. It is not in the king’s best interest to tolerate them. Let a decree be issued to destroy them!

The king, unaware of Esther's heritage, agrees and signs the decree. The Jews across the kingdom are thrown into mourning.

### Act 4: Esther's Dilemma

Mordecai sends word to Esther, urging her to plead with the king for her people. Esther is troubled, knowing that approaching the king uninvited could mean death.

**Mordecai:** (through a messenger) Do not think that because you are in the king's house, you alone of all the Jews will escape. Who knows but that you have come to your royal position for such a time as this?

**Esther:** (resolute) Go, gather all the Jews in Susa, and fast for me. I will go to the king, even though it is against the law. And if I perish, I perish.

### Act 5: Esther's Courage

Esther, adorned in royal robes, approaches the king's throne room. The king, seeing her, extends his golden scepter, sparing her life.

**King Ahasuerus:** (warmly) What is it, Queen Esther? What is your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it will be given you.

**Esther:** (humbly) If it pleases the king, let the king and Haman come to a banquet I have prepared.

During the banquet, Esther reveals her Jewish identity and exposes Haman's plot.

**Esther:** (with emotion) The adversary and enemy is this vile Haman!

The king, enraged, orders Haman to be hanged on the very gallows he had prepared for Mordecai.
